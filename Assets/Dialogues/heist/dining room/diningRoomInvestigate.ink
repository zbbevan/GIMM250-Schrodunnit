High quality wood, and all this … modern art? #sprite:freyja_think
Is this really worth millions of dollars? #speaker:Freyja #portrait:freyja
Half the appliances in here, I couldn’t even dream of affording half of them.

Not millions of dollars worth of appeal. 
Maybe around fifty dollars of appeal. #sprite:detective_basic

Take a good look around for me, yeah? #sprite:freyja_basic
