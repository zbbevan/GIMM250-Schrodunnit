This dining room is so … fancy. #speaker:Freyja #portrait:freyja
High quality wood, and all this … modern art? 
Is this really worth millions of dollars? #speaker:Freyja #portrait:freyja
Half the appliances in here, I couldn’t even dream of affording half of them. 
It’s got some mysterious appeal, I guess. #speaker:Detective portrait:detective
Not millions of dollars worth of appeal. 
Maybe around fifty dollars of appeal. 
Still, something just feels … off, about this place though. #speaker:Freyja #portrait:freyja
Take a good look around for me, yeah?
