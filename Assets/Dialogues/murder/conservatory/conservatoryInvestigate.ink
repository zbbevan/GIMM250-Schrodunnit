Detective, hi! #speaker:Stubbs #portrait:stubbs #sprite:stubbs_happy
This room is sort of empty, isnâ€™t it?
Usually conservatories are full of plants.
Maybe the owner moved them to a different room...
That big observatory is really creepy too.  #sprite:stubbs_basic #sprite:detective_alert
Everytime I look at it, I get the shivers.
Anyways, do you see anything here that could be a clue? #sprite:detective_basic
