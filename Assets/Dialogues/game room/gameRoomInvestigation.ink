This recreation room doesn’t seem like it’s been used in a long time. #speaker:Bingus #portrait:bingus
Just look at all this dust; very unbecoming of a room that should be alive with revelry.
Everything is placed in perfect position, though.
Yeah, almost too perfect.  #speaker:Detective, #portrait:detective
Kinda suggests that someone was trying to make it seem put together. 
But, like you said, the layers of dust disprove that idea… 
I’d better investigate further.
