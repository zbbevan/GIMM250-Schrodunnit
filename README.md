# GIMM250-Schrodunnit



This was a group project created for a Boise State University GIMM class. Our goal was to create an "interactive comic" based off of a complex, quantum-physics based concept. Our group was tasked with "Schrodinger's Cat". We decided to create a psuedo-murder mystery, using "i-spy" like mechanics and branchign dialogue options to craft our game. 

Created by Zachary Bevan, Nolan Woodhouse, Teagan Foster, Alex Ross, and Andrii Pylypiv, 2024.
